# AWS WAFv2, associated with the internet-facing ALB. This is the layer that
# filters a request before it ever reaches api/web/Keycloak — SQLi payloads,
# known exploit signatures, and abusive source IPs are dropped at the edge
# instead of relying solely on the application's own input validation (the
# zod DTOs) and rate limiting (@nestjs/throttler) further in. Defense in
# depth: none of those layers replaces the others.
